##### This project reinforced my passion for data and demonstrated how meaningful insights can transform business strategies. It can be used effectively in R Studio for data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling. It is ideal for building dashboards, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and creating predictive models with packages like ggplot2, dplyr, tidyverse, and caret
##### Key Highlights of the Project:-
Sales Analysis: Identified regional trends and high-performing product categories.
Profitability Insights: Highlighted the impact of discounts and shipping modes on profits.
Customer Segmentation: Explored purchase behaviors across Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office segments.

##### Tools and Techniques Used:-
R Programming: Data manipulation and modeling with dplyr and tidyverse.
Visualization: Built interactive dashboards to make data-driven decisions accessible.
Predictive Modeling: Forecasted sales trends using statistical methods.
